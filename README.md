#Credit Calculation
Maturity Options: Loan maturity options (formOptionMaturities) are defined as a specific list and presented with a select element for the user to make a selection.
Calculation: When the user enters the loan amount and maturity and presses the Calculate button, the loan payment is calculated and the result is shown to the user.
This code is structured so that users can easily calculate loan payments and see recommended loans based on a specific route.
